# meine-java-projekte
Here you will find Java projects that I have programmed in my free time and would like to publish.


GravityMaterieSimulator16122021.zip and KreisGravitationSim16_12But.jar:
Hello,
Would you like to work with me on a gravity simulator? The aim is to show the movements of different numbers of particles with different masses in 3D space. I have already written a Java program which does this in a partially fascinating way. I am happy to send you this so that we can continue to improve the simulator together. And maybe something completely revolutionary for the physical knowledge will develop from us!
If you are interested, please write me a message.

KreisGravitationSim16_12But.jar:
You generate the space-time by repeated clicking. Does the interaction between the circles, based on the gravitational formula, create shapes that look somehow familiar?

GravityMaterieSimulator16122021.zip:
After you have tested the jar file as a demo, you can use my java code, familiarize yourself with it and experiment with the various simulations that I have already implemented.


Mandelbrotmenge.zip: 
Java code for generating images from the Mandelbrot set. This code was the basis for a good friend of mine's application video for Sound and Music Production.

Speedpow.zip: I asked myself why the default division of two integers in many programming languages, contrary to any mathematical convention,
returns an integer and no float or double or only an integer if the modulo value in a case distinction is 0 ...
The way I see it, it can only be due to the existence of an algorithm
On the one hand: it has to be very good
On the other hand, it was not adaptable or must have been based on the fact that the primitive integer division incorrectly returns
an integer and simply cuts off the fractional part as long as you do not change either the dividend or divisor to a number type with decimal places. Example: Instead of 3/5 = 0
3.0 / 5 = 0.6
Perhaps it was due to the algorithm for multiplication and exponentiation with logarithmic speed.

What do you think about? Did you know the problem? Or did you not think about it at all? If so, please bring these thoughts
to other computer scientists ...

What I also find very interesting and would like to implement:
The strategic board game Go:
