# meine-java-projekte
Here you will find Java projects that I have programmed in my free time and would like to publish.
GravityMaterieSimulator16122021.zip and KreisGravitationSim16_12But.jar:
Hello,
Would you like to work with me on a gravity simulator? The aim is to show the movements of different numbers of particles with different masses in 3D space. I have already written a Java program which does this in a partially fascinating way. I am happy to send you this so that we can continue to improve the simulator together. And maybe something completely revolutionary for the physical knowledge will develop from us!
If you are interested, please write me a message.

Best Regards
Andreas
